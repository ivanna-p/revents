This is practice app for the "Build an app with React, Redux and Firestore from scratch" 
course from Udemy.

Not my idea or something, but very cute thing,
way to learn that less is more.
Let me elaborate: 70 lines of code in PHP + HTML + CSS equals 20 lines of code in 
JS with React, semantic-ui and other libraries. 

I know, I know, PHP is backend language and JS is frontend, but after creating whole website only
with PHP, HTML, CSS and only light JS - this is the light at the end of a tunel.
